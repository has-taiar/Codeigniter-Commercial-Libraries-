Description:
Few libraries for Codeigniter for integrating with few commercial gateways
like Paypalexpress, Australian Post, Xero Accounting Package, and few others. 
I worked on this a while back and wanted to document my code so that hopefully somebody else can make
use of my code and find it useful to save the time of writing/coding it. 

Most of this code is based on the work of other people, examples from the gateways, and other sources.
